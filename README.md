![screenshot](./app_screenshot.png)

The purpose of this project is to give us a chance to actually build some forms, both using nearly-pure HTML and then graduating to using the helper methods that Rails provides. Once we build a basic form,  we will be integrating a signup form with our Rails application and providing help if the user enters incorrect information.

## Built With
